React: WEEKEND ASSIGNMENT
React ‚Äì Match Finding
The following exercise contains the following subjects:
‚óè JSX
‚óè Props
‚óè State
Instructions:
We are going to create a fun matching app.
Select any topic you want to base the app on,
For example, animals, sports, relationships, etc.
Live demo
Display:
‚óè Top menu, two pictures one for the positive one for the negative
and next to each there is a counter.
‚óè Display of an image and description on the center of the screen.
‚óè Bottom menu: two buttons, one for positive and one for negative.
The flow of the app:
The app gets fake information that contains at least a picture and
description.
One image is displayed at a time.
When you click on one of the icons in the bottom menu we will move to
the next image, and at the same time the counter next to the
corresponding icon in the top menu will go up in one.
